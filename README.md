# Favorite Books Flask Application

## Overview
This application diplays my faovrite books using predefined list stored in the app.py.
The book list is defined in the Python code and rendered using a Jinja template. 
I added two routes: 
- `/` (Home page)
- `/books` (Displays the list of favorite books)
The '/books' route renders a template with the book list.
